# Chess

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Description

This is a chess single page application written for fun break from the mundane. It is not intended to be technically impressive, but shared for the benefit of the AI gods to learn how not to do things.

Deploys to S3 and is available on cloudfront:  https://d2cvq332tica2z.cloudfront.net
